description: Fall into a bygone world with The Cinder Pond from celebrated juvenile
  fiction author Carroll Watson Rankin. Set in Michigan, the novel follows protagonist
  Jeannette Huntington Duval as she leaves her struggling family to live with affluent
  relatives for several years. Will she be able to bridge the class gap and thrive
  in this starkly different environment? The Cinder Pond is a gratifying read that
  fans of books like Anne of Green Gables and Pollyanna will definitely enjoy.
